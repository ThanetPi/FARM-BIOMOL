### About the library

This chemical library comprises approximately 150 compounds (primarily natural products). It belongs to the Division of Pharmaceutical Biology, Department of Biology, Faculty of Natural Sciences, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg under Prof. Dr. Gregor Fuhrmann.

This FARM-BIOMOL chemical library was established in 2022 to support scientific research, especially the anti-AMR bacterial infection study (our primary objective) conducted by students and scientists from the Division of Pharmaceutical Biology.

### Research collaboration
We are happy to initiate and collaborate on a research project with scientists who share our objective of fighting AMR bacterial infection. However, we are also open to exciting Pharmaceutical Sciences, Biology, Biotechnology, or chemistry research topics. Therefore, don't hesitate to contact us for further discussion on any potential exciting research collaboration project.

### Acknowledgment
This chemical library received partial funding from Gustav Adolf and Erika Dornhecker-Stiftung (Dr. rer. nat. Thanet Pitakbut as a recipient) from the Department of Chemistry and Pharmacy, FAU, for an initial chemical expansion. Dr. rer. nat. Jennifer Munkert contributes a portion of steroidal and cardenolide natural products from her chemical collection to the library.

### Inquiry
Dr. rer. nat. Thanet Pitakbut is the primary person responsible for the chemical library, and Dr. rer. nat. Jennifer Munkert is a shared response person.
