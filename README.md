# FArmBioMoL Chemical Library @FAU-PharmBio

### About the library
This chemical library comprises approximately 150 compounds (primarily natural products). It belongs to the Division of Pharmaceutical Biology, Department of Biology, Faculty of Natural Sciences, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg under Prof. Dr. Gregore Furhmann.

This FArmBioMoL chemical library was established in 2022 to support scientific research, especially the anti-AMR bacterial infection study (our primary objective) conducted by students and scientists from the Division of Pharmaceutical Biology.

### Research collaboration
We are happy to initiate and collaborate on a research project with scientists who share our objective of fighting AMR bacterial infection. However, we are also open to exciting research topics in Pharmaceutical Sciences, Biology, Biotechnology, and chemistry. Don't hesitate to contact us for further discussion.

### Acknowledgment
This chemical library received partial funding from Gustav Adolf and Erika Dornhecker-Stiftung from the Department of Chemistry and Pharmacy, FAU, for an initial chemical expansion.
